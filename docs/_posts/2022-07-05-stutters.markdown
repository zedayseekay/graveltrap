## AMD Ryzen microstutters

If you are using fTPM with Ryzen you may be affected by microstutters. Most motherboard manufacturers have now released a BIOS update, so if you're

- have a mysterious stutter
- have fTPM enabled

This applies to both triples and VR.

AMD's release fix was AMD AGESA V2 1.2.0.7, so check the release notes for your motherboard's update to see whether it includes that release. If not you'll have to wait a while longer...
