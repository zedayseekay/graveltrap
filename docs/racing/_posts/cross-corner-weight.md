# Cross weight (and corner weights)
## What is it?
*Cross-weight* (aka *wedge*)is a convenient metric that gives a good indication of whether your setup has a natural bias to left- or right- turns as a result of weight distribution around the car. 

In road racing the car usually needs to turn well in both directions, but there are some circuits where there are a couple of turns that vastly outweigh all the others in terms of making laptime, so this metric can be helpful - but this gets *very* complex because the advantage in one direction is usually outweighed by the disadvantage in the other, so you'd better *really* mean it if you're using it on a road circuit. Either way, it's still a great quick way to check you're not accidentally running this type of bias and enables you to tune it out.

In oval racing it is extremely common to set up the car with a left-turn bias ("run some wedge") because this is the fastest way around an anticlockwise oval, so getting this exactly right is a way of tuning relative tyre wear and getting into and off turns. (Ovals are further complicated by running "stagger" where the car is not even intended to sit flat in terms of ride height, and runs different size tyres, which obviously completely changes the left-right weight game too.)

As with all biases in setup, it has a different effect on different phases of the corner. High cross-weight (or "wedge") will make the car understeer more in a left turn in general, but it will also put much more lod on the left rear so the car will drive OUT of turns on throttle much better.

## Why does it matter?
Cars are not built symmetrical - that's usually a key design goal but goals are not always achieveable. Furthermore when you are turning laps it is the all-up weight that matters *including the driver* so in any tin-top two-seater, there's something like 85kg<sup>1</sup> "ballast" (yeah, that's you) off-centre on driver's side. The cars are designed around that, so stuff like heavy battery, fire-fighting kit and electronics go passenger side to balance it out, but there's a limit to what you can balance that way.

<sup>1</sup> Nothing personal - this example of 85kg is the driver weight SRO use for homologation. In those series, if the average driver weight is under 85kg, you also have to add ballast. If your average driver weight is *over* 85kg, you should probably add a team nutritionist.
## How-to
* A car with no weight bias of this kind will measure 50% cross-weight, also sometimes expressed as zero wedge.
