# Hello! This is where you manage which Jekyll version is used to run.
# When you want to use a different version, change it below, save the
# file and run `bundle install`. Run Jekyll with `bundle exec`, like so:
#
#     bundle exec jekyll serve
#
# This will help ensure the proper Jekyll version is running.
# Happy Jekylling!
# gem "jekyll", "~> 4.2.2" 
# (Commented out because the github-pages gem declares a dependency
# that will force the correct version of jekyll anyway)

# This is the default theme for new Jekyll sites. You may change this to anything you like.

# If you want to use GitHub Pages, remove the "gem "jekyll"" above and
# uncomment the line below. To upgrade, run `bundle update github-pages`.

# Windows and JRuby does not include zoneinfo files, so bundle the tzinfo-data gem
# and associated library.
