## Bootcamp drivers for MacBook 

iRacing is currently having some... difficulties... running on Bootcamp installations.

The problem is fixed in the latest AMD drivers for Windows; but the Apple-approved Bootcamp download of those drivers is well behind this version. The only answer is to install the unsupported, but newest, drivers yourself.

The affected Macs are those with Radeon 5xx GPUs. Per [a post from iRacing staff](https://forums.iracing.com/discussion/comment/191444/#Comment_191444) the affected 5xx generations are Polaris 21, Polaris 22, and Ellesmere.

There is an official post from iRacing [with instructions](https://forums.iracing.com/discussion/25240/attention-mac-bootcamp-users-who-are-unable-to-launch-the-sim/p1]). This will update the drivers to version 22.x.x - a lot newer than the latest official Bootcamp download from Apple.

The latest *official* AMD drivers for Apple Mac equipment can be found [on AMD's website](https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/release-notes/apple-boot-camp). The second version 21.30.44.07 is for 2019 PowerBooks; everything else uses the earlier version 20.45.40.15.
